Two pointers - initialise two variables which moves towards or away from each other or in the same direction.
It reduces time complexity of arrays or strings from O(n^2) to O(n).
A pointer is a variable that represents an index or position within a data structure such as array or linked list.
Converging pointers-pointers start at opp end of data structure and move inward.
Parallel pointers- both pointers start at same end (right pointer explores new info and the left one tracks progress or maintains constraints(sliding window).
Trigger based pointers - first move first pointer when a condition is met move the sec one(ex-finding the nth node of a linked list)
Used on linear data struc like-array, string, linked list, pair of values or a result that can be generated by two values .
It works best on sorted arrays.
